## Installation

Firstly, we do not support `py2` – the only support provided is for `python 3.6` and greater. <br />
So please ensure you have `python 3.6` or greater installed.

In order to install `OCSysInfo`, you can either download the repository manually via GitHub, and run the `main.py` script located inside of `src` (do also make sure to install the dependencies as shown below), or, via git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iabtw/OCSysInfo.git

cd OCSysInfo

# Installing dependencies on Windows
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-Windows.txt

# Installing dependencies on Linux
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-Linux.txt

# Installing dependencies on macOS
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-macOS.txt
```

## Implementations

OCSysInfo takes advantage of each platform's native interaction protocol, except for Linux, which uses a pseudo file system & its distros expose no consistent way of obtaining this information via command/API, in order to extract information about the system's hardware manually.

### Windows

- `WMI`

  - Windows's WMI (`Windows Management Instrumentation`) is a protocol allowing us to obtain the current system's data—which is practically anything that we could ever ask for. (Some PCI devices even construct the `PCIROOT` path where available! Though, generally this data isn't reliable). Data that we look for are as follows (per class):

    - `Win32_Processor` — information about the current system's CPU in use. Though, we only seek out the following properties:
      - `Manufacturer`
      - `Name`
      - `NumberOfCores`
      - `NumberOfLogicalProcessors`
      - CPU BaseFamily and “CombinedModel” – since we manually construct BaseModel and ExternalModel by simply doing the following:
        - ExternalModel: `(n >> 0x4) & 0xf`
        - BaseModel: `n & 0xf`
      - CPU ExternalFamily is constructed by [getting the return value of the `EAX` register](https://github.com/iabtw/OCSysInfo/blob/main/src/dumps/Windows/win.py#L41-L44), and performing a right bit shift 20 times, and using the logical `AND` operator with the value `0xf`: `(eax >> 20) & 0xf`

    <br />

    - `Win32_VideoController` — information about the current system's **GPU devices** in use. The only properties we seek out are `Name` (the GPU's friendly name) and `PNPDeviceID`, which is basically its PCI path; it includes the device id and vendor id, which we extract.

    - `Win32_NetworkAdapter` — information about [...] system's **Network controllers** available. We only want the `PNPDeviceID` property, from which we can extract the device/vendor id, which we use to query `devicehunt.com` and `pci-ids.ucw.cz` if nothing was found in `devicehunt.com`; the application does _not_ push the device if it cannot be found on either site.

    - `Win32_SoundDevice` — information about [...] system's **audio I/O controllers** available. As with the network adapter, we only care about `PNPDeviceID`.

    - `Win32_BaseBoard` — information about [...] system's **motherboard**, we only care about the `Product` (motherboard model) and `Manufacturer` (vendor name) properties.

    - `Win32_Keyboard` — information about [...] system's **keyboard(s)**, their connection types, and possibly their display names. We only look for the `Description` (type of connector + display name), and the `DeviceID` property.

    - `Win32_PointingDevice` — same as the one item before, but instead for **mice**/**trackpads**/**touchpads**/etc.

### macOS

- `sysctl`

  - macOS's `sysctl` command exposes a way for us to obtain information about the CPU with ease. The key features of this, which we need, are:

    - CPU model
    - CPU instruction flags
    - Core count
    - Thread count
    - Maximum supported SSE version
    - SSSE3 support
    - CPU BaseFamily
    - CPU ExtendedFamily
    - CPU BaseModel
    - CPU ExtendedModel

- `IOKit`

  - Apple's `IOKit` framework allows us to interact with the system's devices (we only seek out `IOPCIDevice` and `IOHDACodecDevice`, as more information would be overtly useless to us.)

  - We filter by using `IOPCIClassMatch`, which can serve as a bit mask match, where the goal is to match the type of device exposed through `class-code` (i.e. display controllers will generally have a bit that's equal to `0x03`, multimedia controllers have a bit that's equal to `0x04`, etc.)

  - With `IOPCIDevice`, we're looking for PCI devices which have a specific bit mask, and we obtain the model (if exposed), device ID and vendor ID through there.

  - With `IOHDACodecDevice`, we simply seek out built-in audio controllers that have an HDA codec present. If nothing, that suffices our criteria, is returned, we simply look into `0x04` (bit for PCI multimedia controllers.)

### Linux

- `sysfs`

  - Devices enumerated as `drm` (`/sys/class/drm`) devices are taken into account with the identity of a GPU; which are looked at if `cardX` directories are found. The directories of these enumerations will generally contain a `cardX/device/device` and `cardX/device/vendor` file.

  - Devices enumerated inside of `/sys/class/net` are classified only if they contain a `*/device/device` and `*/device/vendor` file (so that we can at least have a strong assumption that it'd be a valid network controller.)

  - Devices enumerated inside of `/sys/class/sound` are looked at for the audio controllers — generally, they'll have a relatively similar enumerations as `drm` devices — as a `cardX` format.

- `proc`

  - We are able to take advantage of what is enumerated and the type of data available in Linux's `procfs` pseudo filesystem. For example, we may look into `/proc/bus/input/devices` to list all the names and paths of each input device, and of course, its location in `sysfs` — which is of use for us.

  - We may also find `/proc/cpuinfo`, which holds data about the current system's CPU. Though, generally, thread count isn't explicitly stated as is, but rather, each thread has its own set of data enumerated in `cpuinfo`'s dump, so we may simply get the thread count by doing: `<cpuinfo>.count('processor')`
