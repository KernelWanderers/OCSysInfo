# WIP: This script will assist contributors in adding support for a language in OCSysInfo.

"""
- Read english json file and take it as the base format.
- ask a name for the language, both ascii and non-ascii (if applicable)
- loop through each key in the english json file and ask the user to translate it.
- provide the key name, and the value for reference
- check for {} count and if it is not equal, ask the user to fix it.
